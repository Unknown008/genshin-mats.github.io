# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Just a little project I wanted to work on that helps planning when to farm mats and how to allocate resin efficiently for the characters you have and want to develop.

Assets obtained from:
- [Genshin Impact Wikia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki)
- [genshin.gg](https://genshin.gg/)

# FAQs
Q: Where is Sunday?
A: Sunday is a weird day in Genshin Impact. The domains that usually drop one type of material is able to drop any of the material it usually drops on other days. Some people recommend not farming domains of Sundays if you are trying to get a specific character/weapon (thus a specific material) upgraded. If you want to get everything, then just go for it even on Sundays.

Q: Why is Traveller (MC) not in the chart?
A: Traveller (MC) requires a lot of books from different regions depending on the element he/she is in. For example, Anemo traveller requires 3 Green Freedom books to upgrade level 1 talents, but 2 Blue Resistance books to upgrade level 2 talents.

Q: Can you show the weapons instead?
A: That will be hard without making the page become huge. Different weapons require different materials even in the same category. For example, Prototype Aminus requires Aerosite, but Wolf's Gravestone requires Shackles.
