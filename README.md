# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Just a little project I wanted to work on that helps planning when to farm mats and how to allocate resin efficiently for the characters you have and want to develop.

Assets obtained from:
- [Genshin Impact Wikia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki)
- [genshin.gg](https://genshin.gg/)
- [genshin.cc](https://genshin.cc/)

# FAQs
**Q: Where is Sunday?**  
A: Sunday has not been included since you can farm every material a domain usually drops on the weekdays.

**Q: Why is Traveller (MC) not in the chart?**  
A: Traveller (MC) requires a lot of books from different regions depending on the element he/she is in. For example, Anemo traveller requires 3 Green Freedom books to upgrade level 1 talents, but 2 Blue Resistance books to upgrade level 2 talents.

**Q: Can you show the weapons instead?**  
A: That will be hard without making the page become huge. Different weapons require different materials even in the same category. For example, Prototype Archaic requires Aerosite, but Wolf's Gravestone requires Shackles, even if both are Claymores.

**Q: This and that character is not listed. Can you add them? When will you add them?**
A: I will add characters that get released as soon as possible. If I forgot for some reason and you can't wait, feel free to add me on discord (my tag is Unknown008#4135) and leave me a message.
